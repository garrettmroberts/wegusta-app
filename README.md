## Getting started
1. There are two options for running this application.  Both have different software requirements:
    - Option #1. Install xCode and an iOS instance to your computer.
    - Option #2. Install the Expo app to your iPhone.
2. In the terminal, type `npm run dev`.
3. Once the app is running locally, you can type `i` to run the app on your iOS simulator.  Otherwise, your terminal will display a QR code that you can scan and view the app on your mobile device.  (The app should theoretically also run well on Android devices, but I haven't tested it extensively.)
